In this project, we will be investigating data from the [r/politics](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/) subreddit which, according to the site description, is intended for "news and discussions about U.S. politics."

We'll be investigating the activity of redditors posting and commenting on submissions mentioning either "Trump" or "Biden" between 10-01-2020 and 11-2-2020, being the period immediately preceding the most recent U.S. presidential election. 

The 2020 U.S. election was a significant global event surrounded by controversy since rigging and result manipulations surround it. The main figures were the Republican Party's Donald Trump attempting to secure a second term while the Democratic Party's Joe Biden planned to turn it around.

Our aim with the project is to discover any shifts in sentiment relating to the two, at the time, presidential candidates, and to investigate how such potential sentiment changes relate to polling data obtained during the same period. We expect to see a significant correlation between the sentiment expressed in the online forum and polling data obtained by third-party polling firms. 

Furthermore, we will create and analyze the network of the redditors who took part in the discussions on r/politics to hopefully discover interesting insights about the interactions of members of the subreddit during the final weeks before the election day. Finally, we will seek to create a partitioning of the network of redditors, based on their expressed sentiment regarding either of the two candidates. This partitioning will be our rather na√Øve attempt at inferring the political convictions of the site members, which we will compare with actual polling data.

We have split our findings into three separate pages, accesible in the top menu, covering
1. The used data
2. The analysed text 
3. The constructed network of redditors

This website is meant as a general overview of our findings. For the more interested reader, we include a link to a Jupyter Notebook file containing the Python code used for the analyses:

We hope you find our results interesting. <br>
Enjoy!
